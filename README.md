Emotion Detection from Facial Expressions
This project focuses on detecting emotions from facial expressions using machine learning and deep learning models. The primary dataset used is the FER2023 dataset, which contains images of faces labeled with different emotions. The objective is to classify these images into different emotional categories based on facial features.

Models Used
Various machine learning and deep learning models were implemented and compared for emotion detection:

1. Decision Tree
A Decision Tree model was used for emotion classification, achieving the highest accuracy of 99%. The Decision Tree algorithm splits the dataset into subsets based on the feature values, making it easy to interpret and visualize. It is particularly useful for problems that require a clear decision-making process, such as classification tasks.

2. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
The KNN algorithm achieved 96% accuracy. KNN works by comparing a given image to its nearest neighbors and classifying it based on the majority vote of those neighbors. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective algorithm, particularly when the dataset is relatively clean and well-structured.

3. Random Forest
Random Forest, an ensemble method using multiple decision trees, achieved 96% accuracy. This model benefits from averaging predictions across multiple decision trees, reducing the risk of overfitting and providing more robust predictions.

4. Voting Classifier
The Voting Classifier combined predictions from multiple models, including XGBoost and SVM, to improve overall accuracy. This ensemble method resulted in an accuracy of 95%, showing the potential of combining multiple algorithms to achieve better results.

5. XGBoost
XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting method, achieved 94% accuracy. It is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets and complex features, making it a strong choice for classification tasks.

6. DeepFace
DeepFace is a deep learning model leveraging pre-trained neural networks for emotion detection, achieving 55% accuracy. DeepFace analyzes facial features directly to predict emotions, offering a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of facial expressions compared to traditional methods.

7. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
CNNs, which are specifically designed for image classification tasks, achieved 68% accuracy. CNNs automatically extract relevant features from images using convolutional layers, making them highly effective for tasks like emotion detection, although they require more training and tuning.

8. Transfer Learning (VGG16)
Transfer learning with the VGG16 model achieved 53% accuracy. By using pre-trained weights from the VGG16 model, the model benefits from features learned from large image datasets, but requires further fine-tuning for the specific task of emotion recognition.

9. SVM (Support Vector Machine)
SVM, a powerful classifier, achieved 37% accuracy in this project. While SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces, it struggled with the complexities of facial expression data in this case.

Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps varied depending on the model used. Some models, such as VGG16, required the images to be resized and normalized before feeding them into the model. Other models like KNN, SVM, and Random Forest relied on feature extraction techniques such as HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve performance.

Evaluation
Each model's performance was evaluated based on its accuracy, with Decision Tree achieving the highest accuracy. However, other models such as KNN, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier also showed promising results. The use of DeepFace and VGG16 demonstrated the potential of leveraging pre-trained deep learning models for emotion detection, although further tuning and training are needed to improve their accuracy for this specific task.

Challenges and Limitations
Overfitting: Some models, particularly complex deep learning models, showed signs of overfitting due to the limited size of the dataset. This could be mitigated by using data augmentation or regularization techniques.
Dataset Quality: The quality and variety of the FER2023 dataset, including variations in facial expressions, lighting, and pose, impacted the model performance. Larger, more diverse datasets would likely improve model accuracy.
High-Dimensional Features: Models like SVM faced challenges with the high-dimensional data, which may have led to suboptimal performance.
Conclusion
The project demonstrated the application of various machine learning and deep learning models for emotion detection from facial expressions. While traditional models like KNN and Random Forest performed well, DeepFace and Transfer Learning showed the potential of using pre-trained deep learning models. The results suggest that further fine-tuning and adjustments to the models, especially deep learning models, could lead to better performance in future iterations.
